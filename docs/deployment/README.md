## [TARGET] Deployment Paths

### Path 1: Your Own VPS (Recommended)

**Cost:** $0/month (using existing infrastructure)  
**Time:** 40 minutes  
**Result:** Ready to launch globally

**Steps:**
1. Read [LAUNCH_STRATEGY_COMMUNITY.md](./LAUNCH_STRATEGY_COMMUNITY.md)
2. Follow [DEPLOY_NOW_VPS.md](./DEPLOY_NOW_VPS.md)
3. Deploy on your 2 existing VPS
4. Launch with 2 nodes
5. Let community add more nodes organically

**Why this is best:**
- [OK] $0/month forever
- [OK] 100% control
- [OK] True decentralization
- [OK] Community-owned infrastructure
- [OK] Sustainable long-term

---

### Path 2: Cloud Platform (Not Recommended)

**Cost:** $15-30/month  
**Time:** 15 minutes  
**Result:** Fast setup but centralized

**Why we don't recommend:**
- [NO] Monthly costs forever
- [NO] Platform dependency
- [NO] Can be shut down by ToS
- [NO] Not truly decentralized
- [NO] You become "infrastructure provider"

**Better approach:** Use your own VPS, let community run additional nodes

---

## [IDEA] Philosophy

### The FRW Way: Community-First

**NOT the FRW way:**
```
[NO] One person pays for all nodes worldwide
[NO] Becomes "infrastructure provider"
[NO] Everyone depends on one person
[NO] Financial burden forever
[NO] Single point of failure
```

**THE FRW way:**
```
[OK] YOU run 2 nodes on existing VPS ($0 extra cost)
[OK] COMMUNITY runs nodes where they live
[OK] Network grows organically
[OK] No single point of failure
[OK] TRUE decentralization
[OK] Sustainable forever
```
