## Red Flag Responses

### If Launch Flops (< 50 stars Week 1)

**Don't panic. Ask:**
1. Was timing wrong? (Friday/weekend?)
2. Was message unclear?
3. Was platform wrong? (Try different subreddit?)
4. Was it too technical? (Simplify?)
5. Was proof missing? (Need demo video?)

**Action:**
- Get feedback from 5 people
- Revise message
- Try different platform
- Add visuals/demo
- Relaunch in 2 weeks

### If Community Turns Hostile

**Immediate:**
1. Pause posting new content
2. Review Code of Conduct
3. Address legitimate concerns
4. Ban trolls (don't engage)
5. Rally positive community

**Long-term:**
1. Clear moderation guidelines
2. Empower moderators
3. Create safe spaces (Discord, etc)
4. Lead by example (stay calm)

### If You're Burning Out

**Signs:**

**Solutions:**
