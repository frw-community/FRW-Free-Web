## [IDEA] Core Strategic Principles

### 1. Positioning

**NOT:**
- [NO] "Web 3.0" (crypto scams)
- [NO] "Revolutionary" (sounds hype)
- [NO] "Blockchain-based" (slow, expensive)

**BUT:**
- [OK] "Web 1.0 Done Right"
- [OK] "The Internet, Before It Was Captured"
- [OK] "Your Content. Your Control."
- [OK] "Fixing What Went Wrong"

### 2. Community-First

- You run 2 nodes ($0/month)
- Community runs nodes where they live
- Network grows organically
- No single point of failure
- TRUE decentralization

### 3. Never Compromise

**4 Sacred Rules:**
1. Decentralization - No shortcuts, ever
2. UX = Platforms - Must be easy as Medium/Substack
3. Community First - They run infrastructure
4. No Investors - No VCs, pure protocol

### 4. You're Building a Protocol

**Not:**
- [NO] A company
- [NO] A platform
- [NO] A startup

**But:**
- [OK] A PROTOCOL (like HTTP, Email)
- [OK] Can't be shut down
- [OK] Can't be bought
- [OK] Just works forever

---

## [TARGET] Key Audiences

### Early Adopters (Year 1)
- Privacy advocates
- Decentralization believers
- Developers
- Platform-burned creators

### Creators (Year 2)
- Independent writers
- Artists
- Musicians
- Communities

### Everyone (Year 3+)
- "Normal people"
- It's just the web
- Standard protocol

---

## [CHART] Success Metrics

### North Star Metric
**"Active sites publishing content weekly"**

### Supporting Metrics
- Total registered users
- New sites per week
- Community nodes running
- GitHub stars
- Press mentions
- Search volume

## [STRONG] What Makes This Different

**HTTP didn't need marketing.**  
**Email didn't need investors.**  
**They just WORKED BETTER.**

**Make FRW work better than platforms.**  
**The rest will follow.**
