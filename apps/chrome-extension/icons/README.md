# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the extension icons in the following sizes:

- icon-16.png (16x16)
- icon-32.png (32x32)
- icon-48.png (48x48)
- icon-128.png (128x128)

## Creating Icons

1. Design a logo that represents the FRW protocol (suggested: globe/network symbol)
2. Export in PNG format at the required sizes
3. Place the files in this directory

## Temporary Solution

For development, you can use placeholder icons:
- https://via.placeholder.com/16
- https://via.placeholder.com/32
- https://via.placeholder.com/48
- https://via.placeholder.com/128

Or create simple colored squares as placeholders.
